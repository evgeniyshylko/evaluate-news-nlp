# Text Analysis Project

The Text Analysis Project integrates with MeaningCloud's Sentiment Analysis API to provide insightful text analysis directly from your web application. Upon submitting text through our interactive form, the application displays analysis results, including subjectivity, agreement, confidence, and irony, offering users deeper understanding of the text sentiment.

## Features

- **Interactive Text Submission**: Users can input text into a form and submit it for analysis.
- **Integration with MeaningCloud Sentiment Analysis API**: Leverages the powerful Sentiment Analysis API for real-time text analysis.
- **Dynamic Result Display**: Shows the analysis results (`subjectivity`, `agreement`, `confidence`, `irony`) dynamically in the form upon submission.
